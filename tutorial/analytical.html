          Analysis of JMS and Kafka
          <br />
          JMS and Kafka act as ideal solutions for the current usage of
          messaging and communications between different parts of an
          application. They provide an optimal solution for effective
          transmission of data depending on the type and number of consumers and
          producers.
          <br />
          <br />
          When sending messages on Kafka, messages are not queued, but all data
          is extracted from all producers and accumulated which is then routed
          to different consumers. This method of handling data is dynamic. It
          provides a highly scalable solution as there is no one-to-one
          connection or integration being established, this way any number of
          consumers and producers can be added. A large amount of data can be
          handled as it provides a way of automatic load balancing.
          <br />
          <br />
          JMS on the other hand follows a Queue-(FIFO) approach. JMS is scalable
          to a limit. Messages are sent in a queue. It does not do any automatic
          load balancing. JMS does offer a big advantage and that is filtering.
          JMS uses message selectors for the purpose of filtering.Depending on
          different property values of the message they can be filtered out on
          the basis of the consumerâ€™s interest.
          <br />
          <br />
          At the end of the day these technologies cannot be compared with each
          other, as they both are extremely application specific. Each have
          their own pros and cons. But before designing your application keep
          the following things in your mind.
          <br />
          <br />
          Now that you have gone through the tutorial try thinking of the
          following scenarios and a possible solution as to which is better
          Kafka/ JMS?
          <br />
          <br />
          What is the load of consumers and producers?
          <br />
          <br />
          Do your messages need to be filtered?
          <br />
          <br />
          Do messages need to be ordered based on topics?
          <br />
          <br />
          Does your application need to be scaled massively in the future?
          <br />
          <br />
          Would you like any abstraction while handling data?
          <br />
          <br />

          Answers:
          <br />
          <br />
          Higher load of a consumers would mean Kafka is a better solution.
          <br />
          <br />
          If your messages need to be filtered then definitely JMS.
          <br />
          <br />
          If your messages need to be ordered based on topics then Kafka would
          be ideal.
          <br />
          <br />
          If your application needs to be scaled massively in the future then
          definitely use Kafka.
          <br />
          <br />
          If you need abstraction while handling data use Kafka.
